# Sierra #

A dark low-contrast Vim colorscheme for Terminal Vim and GUI Vim. 

### Inspirations ###

I believe Hans Fugal's [Desert](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=105) to be one of the most well respected and most imitated vim colorscheme to date. Sierra is my attempt to re-create a colorscheme that uses colors found from the high desert. It features cool colors for 'Statements', 'Functions', and 'Variables' each of which are counterbalance by warm 'Constants', 'String', and 'Booleans'. Enjoy!

### Screenshots ###

The following screenshot of Sierra was made using a default Vi IMproved 7.3 displayed in [iTerm 2.1.4](https://www.iterm2.com) with Jose Elera Campana's Plug-in for extending the syntax for JavaScript [vim-javascript-syntax](https://github.com/jelera/vim-javascript-syntax). Enjoy!!
